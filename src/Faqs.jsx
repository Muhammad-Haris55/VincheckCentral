                    <div class="accordion-item-desc">
                        A VIN which stands for (Vehicle Identification Number) is the automotive industry’s way to identify every vehicle, regardless of it being a car, motorcycle, truck, bus, or trailer. While the VIN first appeared in the mid-1900s, there was no standardized and universally accepted VIN format, so every vehicle manufacturer used their own VIN style. The VIN has 17 digits.

                        In 1981, the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) finally standardized the VIN, and from that point forward every vehicle sold was assigned its own unique 17 character-long combinations of letters (capitals included) and numbers. (VINs cannot include the letters I, O, or Q, mostly to avoid them being confused with 1s and 0s).</div>

                    <div class="accordion-item-desc">
                        The two places to locate the VIN are the vehicle’s body and the vehicle’s documentation. The VIN can be found printed at the bottom of the driver’s side windshield, next to the lock under the engine hood, inside the drivers door or on the right of the trunk’s spare wheel compartment. The VIN will also be listed on the car registration, insurance policy, and other varying documentations.</div>
